Assembly notes:  
If you choose to make the housing directly from the included files, you may need to make subtle changes based on the 3d printer/materials used. These were designed for printing on an Anycubic Photon S. 

The screen protector is very slightly to large for the screen opening, so that it may be snapped into place without requiring any other attatchment. It may be 3d printed with clear material using the included stl, or laser cut from clear acrylic using the included svg file.   
  
  The stls for the lid and screen protector include small rounded tabs for easier removal from a resin print plate. They help allow a shim(such as a flexible putty knife) to be slid under the print for relatively easy removal, and then may be easily cut off.
